I’m Tiziano Colagrossi, a PhD researcher in cybersecurity at Sapienza Università di Roma. My work is driven by a passion for securing digital environments and addressing the challenges of modern cyber threats. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that protect both individuals and organizations in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.

However, beyond my academic pursuits, I’m someone who finds balance by engaging in manual work and exploring various hobbies in my free time. Whether it's building something with my hands or diving into new interests, these activities keep me grounded and creative. On this site, you might also find glimpses of the results of those hobbies—an eclectic mix that reflects my curiosity and love for hands-on work.
